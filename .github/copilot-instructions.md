This is a retro-styled HTML5 Canvas game inspired by EthereumOS's GM Heartbeat mechanism. The project uses pure web technologies with Windows 95/98 aesthetic.

## Project Context

- **Visual Style**: Windows 95/98 retro UI with pixel-perfect elements
- **Technology Stack**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Target**: Web browsers with Canvas and Web Audio API support

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use ES6+ JavaScript features where appropriate
- Maintain retro Windows 95/98 aesthetic in all UI elements
- Include EthereumOS branding and color scheme (#4a9eff blue diamond logo)
- Implement responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Use MS Sans Serif font family for authenticity
- Follow game development best practices for Canvas rendering

## Key Features to Maintain
- 48-hour virtual time challenge system
- GM button clicking mechanics with 3-second expiration
- Progressive difficulty with increasing spawn rates
- Health system with penalties and bonuses
- Streak-based scoring with multipliers
- Particle effects and visual feedback
- Web Audio API for retro sound effects

## Development Notes
- Canvas rendering at 60fps target
- Pure JavaScript without external dependencies
- Keyboard shortcuts (Space, Ctrl+R) for accessibility
- Mobile-responsive design considerations
- Audio context initialization for modern browsers
- Performance optimization for particle systems
